<h2>Initial Im&shy;pres&shy;sions on Dollar Shave Club</h2>
<blockquote>
<strong>TLDR: The Dollar Shave Club 4X Raxor is a solid razor at a fair price.</strong></blockquote>
<div class="figure align-center">

</div>
<p>I bit the bullet. I joined <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/">Dollar Shave Club</a>.</p>
<p>I usually consider myself a fairly frugal person.  Not to the extent that I
crawl forums and cut coupons <em>for the thrill of the deal</em>, but I will usually
eat in before eating out, and I'll definitely use the same crappy razor for
<em>months</em> if I can get away with it.</p>
<p>So why did I join Dollar Shave Club?  To answer that I must reveal the <em>deep
dark secret</em> that <strong>I shave my legs</strong>.  I wouldn't consider it a huge part of
my identity; it's just a thing I do to cure post-shower-itchy-legs <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>.  I
started late in High School, stopped for the first few years of college for
whatever reason, and recently picked it back up.  I tried using some cheap
razor I bought but it wasn't getting the job done.  Legs were just too big a
job for this cheap razor to handle.  I took a hard look in the mirror at
myself, my bad facial-hair, and my terribly shaven legs.  <strong>I decided it was
time</strong>.</p>
<p>The ads had worked and the price was right so I bought the <strong>The 4x</strong>.
Here's what was in the box:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Package Contents." src="/static/dollar-shave-club/box-contents.jpg" style="width: 50%;"/>
</div>
<p>The packaging was thought&shy;ful&shy;ly compact <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>.  I would compare the experience
of opening the box to unpacking a new smart-phone or laptop in that I could
tell <em>my experience was well planned</em>.  There was a clear and in&shy;ten&shy;tion&shy;al
aesthetic design put into the box and the layout of it's contents.  I didn't
expect a box with random shaving implements strewn about, but I wasn't
expected a well crafted package either.  It was fun.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Just the Shaving Stuff." src="/static/dollar-shave-club/just-shaving-stuff.jpg" style="width: 50%;"/>
</div>
<p>I'm not sure what to say about a razor since I don't consider myself an
aficionado on the topic.  What I can say with confidence is that <em>this
particular razor</em> is <strong>a solid razor at a reasonable price</strong>.  In shaving my
legs I didn't cut myself once, and shaving my face was a pleasant enough
experience.  I wasn't blown away by the razor, but I don't think that's Dollar
Shave Club's intention.  It wasn't <em>the closest shave of my life</em>, but it was
a solid experience and I'm gonna keep my sub&shy;scrip&shy;tion.</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: I tried the sample of <strong>Easy Shave Butter</strong> and it was an experiment,
but some soap and water gets the job done just fine for me.  I can really take
it or leave it.  Like I said earlier, I'm frugal so <em>what works for me</em> is
usually what I go for.</p>
