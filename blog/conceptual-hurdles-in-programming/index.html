<h2>Conceptual Hurdles in Pro&shy;gram&shy;ming</h2>
<p>I've been actively learning pro&shy;gram&shy;ming for almost five years now. I started
by taking a C++ class at Portland Community College.  That class was the best
thing to happen to my en&shy;gi&shy;neer&shy;ing career because it taught me that
<em>pro&shy;gram&shy;ming is very hard, and I am not naturally good at it</em>, but it was also
very rewarding so I stuck with it.</p>
<p>I'm not special either, most of us aren't very good at pro&shy;gram&shy;ming because
it's so abstract and hard to grasp, like Math and Infinite Jest. There are of
course the people that seem like <em>pro&shy;gram&shy;ming gods</em>, but nine times out of ten
those people have been pro&shy;gram&shy;ming since they were eight and it's really not
fair to compare yourself to them.  That's like comparing your sporting
abilities to <em>any olympic athlete</em>.  Don't be so hard on yourself.</p>
<p>In learning to program, and now teaching others how to program, I've
identified a few <strong>hurdles</strong> (mountains, cliffs, obstacles, w/e) that folks
tend to hit and have trouble crossing.  They always get past these hurdles
eventually (or they quit CS â˜¹), but not without a bit of un&shy;nec&shy;es&shy;sary struggle.
Struggling builds character, and I don't want to cheat anybody out of that,
but I do want to help those that want it.</p>
<p>This post will in no way guarantee your success in overcoming these obstacles
but it should at least give you a head start to help you understand what you're
learning and point you in the right direction when you want to ask a question.</p>
<div class="section" id="data-structures">
<h3>Data Structures</h3>
<p>Un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing that <strong>a lot of pro&shy;gram&shy;ming is basically ma&shy;nip&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ing data to
fit a need</strong> is pretty important.  A social network can be thought of as a
bunch of people's personal in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion plugged into a bunch of algorithms to
make connecting easier.  A word processor is really just a front-end for some
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_XML_formats">XML under the hood</a>, which is itself <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">just a way to represent structured
data</a>.</p>
<p>When handling data try to keep in mind what you are trying to accomplish and
the best way to structure the data in the pursuit of that goal.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure">Arrays/Lists/Vectors</a></dt>
<dd><strong>Arrays and Lists are an ordered data type</strong>.  Use them when you need to
keep track of the order things happened in, like queuing an event.  Try to
keep them <em>relatively small</em> since they are fast for retrieval but not
inherently space efficient.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash-table/Key-Value/Dictionary</a></dt>
<dd><p class="first"><strong>Hashes are useful for storing unordered data</strong> with keys, like an address
book or a small database. We use them to access data quickly and easily
since data is retrieved using a key and always takes ap&shy;prox&shy;i&shy;mate&shy;ly the
same amount of time.  When you get data out of a dictionary you provide a
key and get back the associated data, just like (you guessed it) <em>a real
dictionary</em> where provided the word you get back a definition.</p>
<p class="last">Hash-tables are useful tools but should only be used for <em>relatively
small</em> amounts of data.  There is a bit of overhead in creating the table
for storing your data so if your data-set gets too big you'll run out of
memory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">Linked Lists/Sorted Trees</a></dt>
<dd><p class="first">Linked Lists and Sorted Trees aren't exactly the same thing but I'm
lumping them together because they both deal with a lot of the same
concepts and can be im&shy;ple&shy;ment&shy;ed in similar ways.  In learning about LL/ST
you'll probably deal with Structs, Nodes, Pointers, and dynamic memory
allocation, which if you're like me will totally break your brain and then
become second-nature.</p>
<p><strong>One advantage to these structures is that they can be im&shy;ple&shy;ment&shy;ed to
take up only the space they require</strong>.  Where Hash-maps and lists are hard
to make the <em>right size</em>, LL/ST can only take up exactly as much room as
they need.  The trade-off (a word you hear a lot when dealing choosing
data structures) is that they're not always the <em>fastest</em> way to
store/retrieve data.  Just consider your use-case and think about what you
need for the task at hand.</p>
<p class="last">If you're interested in learning Rust though there's a great guide on
<a class="reference external" href="http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/README.html">Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists</a>. I do suggest it.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>These are all just the structures you're giving your data</strong> (a series of
ones and zeros on disk and in memory).  Anybody that's done work with a
suf&shy;fi&shy;cient&shy;ly com&shy;pli&shy;cat&shy;ed project (e.g., the Linux Kernel) can tell you that
one glob of data can be treated as a Linked List, Array, Hash -- or all three
at the same time!  The structure you give your data is just so <em>you</em> can work
with it, the computer doesn't really care one way or another, so choose what
makes the most sense.</p>
<p><em>Speaking of data structures...</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objects-classes">
<h3>Objects/Classes</h3>
<p><strong>Objects are logical groupings of data (variables) and functions that act on
that data</strong>.  They differ from structs in that they are (usually) private by
default, meaning that variables declared in an object are not accessible from
the <em>outside</em> unless you explicitly say so. Variables are usually ma&shy;nip&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ed
via a method called a <em>getter</em> and <em>setter</em>.</p>
<p>Well... what I've actually described so far is creating a <strong>class: aka a
blueprint for an object</strong>.  This python is a pretty succinct way to describe
classes and objects:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;
objects_example.py

Declare a class named BazClass.
&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BazClass</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;
        The __init__ function sets class variables and sets up the object.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">var1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">var2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">a</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;
        a() acts on the object variables (accessed via `self`).
        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Variable you set {}&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">var1</span><span class="p">))</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Variable set by class definition {}&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">var2</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;
Creating an instance of the class and call the `a()` function.
&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="n">foo_object</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">BazClass</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">foo_object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>
<p>Objects are something that will <em>click</em> after you use the for a while.
There's some nuances and im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion quirks depending on the language
you're using, but in the end they're just logical col&shy;lec&shy;tions of private data
and functions.</p>

<h3>Functional Pro&shy;gram&shy;ming</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional Pro&shy;gram&shy;ming</a> (FP) was my first big paradigm shift in CS since
functions.  FP includes concepts of variable im&shy;mutabil&shy;i&shy;ty (once it's set it's
set), callbacks (functions calling functions and prop&shy;a&shy;gat&shy;ing results up),
program state -- the list goes on.  Here's an example to get us started.</p>
<p>Non-functional paradigm:</p>
<pre class="code javascript literal-block">
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">average_evens</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">avg</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nx">avg</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">];</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="nx">avg</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">avg</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">avg</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
<p>Functional Paradigm:</p>
<pre class="code javascript literal-block">
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">average_evens</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">reduce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">})</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
<p>In the non-functional example one would create a variable, iterate with a
for-loop, and return a variable at the end.  In the functional example you
call functions which return data that you handle (callback) and that result is
added to or replaces the original data.  I'm honestly not doing this topic
justice but it's one of those things you either learn first or you learn the
hard way.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the ice-berg; many people prefer functional
pro&shy;gram&shy;ming. If you are even remotely interested you should find one of
those people and let them talk your ear off.</p>
<p>If you're learning functional pro&shy;gram&shy;ming I suggest either <a class="reference external" href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">Learn You a
Haskell for Great Good</a> if you're interested in learning Haskell (which is
in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing an in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing language if nothing else) or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/functional-programming-python.csp">Functional
Pro&shy;gram&shy;ming in Python</a> for <em>python&shy;istas</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="frameworks">
<h3>Frameworks</h3>
<p><strong>Frameworks are a collection of libraries, methods, and tools to accomplish a
specific type of task</strong>.  If you want to get something <em>com&shy;pli&shy;cat&shy;ed</em> done
<em>fast</em>, you'll use a framework.  Take for instance a web-app like Facebook or
Twitter: it needs to be able to <em>send/receive HTTP requests</em>, <em>interface with
a database</em> / <em>craft database queries</em>, <em>render web-pages</em>, <em>and</em> whatever the
actual website is supposed to do.</p>
<p>Frameworks can be very small or very large but they are always a big hurdle
for those of us that have never worked with one before.  A good starter
framework I suggest is <a class="reference external" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> for Python-based web-apps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p><strong>Testing is writing a program to test your program</strong>.  There are many different
<em>kinds</em> of tests from <em>unit tests</em> (checking single functions), to
<em>in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion tests</em> (checking that your functions work <em>together</em>), to <em>random
tests</em> (trying to break your program by telling a computer to break your
functions by using they in weird ways).</p>
<p>Remember that first program you wrote for class?  You wrote one that prompted
the user for data and then ma&shy;nip&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ed that input in some way?  Remember how
you tested that?  Probably in the most tedious way imaginable: <strong>by hand</strong>.
Tests are much easier to write than your actual code and while they're a
tedious investment up-front it's a small commitment relative to the <em>hours</em>
you'd spend checking your program every time you made a change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="troubleshooting">
<h3>Trou&shy;bleshoot&shy;ing</h3>
<p>The last thing isn't really about pro&shy;gram&shy;ming but about <em>fixing</em> your
pro&shy;gram&shy;ming.  When you're learning a new paradigm, language, or framework
you're going to spend a lot of time <em>fixing</em> what doesn't currently work much
more than you're going to actually be producing working code.  This skill can
also be summed up as 'How to Read Error Messages and Google well'.</p>
<p>My trou&shy;bleshoot&shy;ing advice is to <em>read</em> the error message, don't give up,
and search for anything that looks meaningful.  Once you find an answer try to
<em>grok</em> what the answer means so you can learn <em>why</em> that worked instead of
knowing <em>if I type this in a certain way it will not fall down</em>.  Future you
will appreciate the investment you put into <em>un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing</em> the problem and
it's solution.</p>
<p>Also don't be afraid to experiment. Make a copy of your program (or use
<a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>) and see if some crazy idea is exactly what you need.</p>
<hr class="docutils"/>
<p>This list is far from complete but it still felt worth sharing.  If you think
I missed something, <a class="reference external" href="/about/#contact">contact me</a> and I might do a follow-up post.</p>
