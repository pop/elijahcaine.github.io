<h3>Write the Docs: Day 2</h3>
<p>Just like yesterday, I spent most of today enjoying some wonderful talks as
well as stressing out -- I mean totally not stressing out -- about my own talk.</p>

<p>The Write the Docs Staff saying thanks.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The first talk of the day was titled &quot;Judas Priest Ate My Scrum Master&quot;,
which has almost nothing to do with Judas Priest or eating or scrum masters;
instead it talked about things that are well known issues and a lot of laws
(<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%E2%80%99_law">Brooks' Law</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman's_laws_of_software_evolution">Lehmann's Laws</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law">Conway's Law</a>,
etc) that nobody talks about that much but can be super helpful to consider
when working in an industry.</li>
<li>The second talk covered different types of user interfaces and what to
consider when writing error messages, trou&shy;bleshoot&shy;ing pages, product tours.
It was something I hadn't considered having primarily written command line
tools with pretty limited and well es&shy;tab&shy;lished interface guidelines.</li>
<li>Then I gave a talk. It was a talk. I'll post a video of it once those
get put up online and you can decide if it was good or bad.</li>
<li>The talk after mine was a nice history lesson and wanted the audience to
reflect on what doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tions can learn from doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion practices of the
past. The TLDR on that one is that it used to suck to write technical docs
even more than it sucks now.</li>
<li>Then there were a bunch of lightning talks. One talk from a twitter employee
(there's a fun name for them I'm sure) mentioned that gathering metrics are
is important because without metrics everything you do is just guess and
check.</li>
<li>The next talk &quot;Mac&shy;Gyver&shy;ing your docs&quot; brought up the fact that the best
doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion toolchain will (should?) only help existing developers. A
better toolchain won't attract new devs. That was something I think a lot of
projects can lose sight of.</li>
<li>The talk after that covered a team of scientists studying clouds (water
clouds not internet clouds) using computer sim&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tions. They wrote and
documented a piece of software and they ended up publishing their program's
doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion in a scientific journal. It's already been sited and
everything. I hadn't even considered that as a pos&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty (publishing docs
as a scientific paper).</li>
<li>The next two talks were pretty short (15 minute) talks about putting the data
where the users need it and an in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;tion to screen-casting. The first was
good for doc&shy;u&shy;ment&shy;ing things like an API and the second was good if I ever
need to make a screen-cast. I doubt that will happen, but you never know!</li>
<li>The last talk &quot;All roads might not lead to docs&quot; held too main takeaways for
me: The quote <em>The Purpose of this document is ________</em> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://voiceandtone.com/">mailchimp
voice &amp; tone guide</a>, which is a very good document I suggest you read it
(the title is pretty self ex&shy;plana&shy;to&shy;ry I think).</li>
</ul>

<p>The after party ended up happening at two venues since we got pre-maturely
kicked out of the first one; we made the best of it and I got to talk to Anna
Jaruga (the cloud research scientist) as well as a <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla De&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment
Network</a> writer, both very in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing people.</p>
