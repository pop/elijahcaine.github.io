<h3>Write the Docs: Day 1</h3>
<p>I spent most of today enjoying the Write the Docs talks and (air
con&shy;di&shy;tioned) venue. I took some notes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The keynote about the imposter syndrome was very relatable. The coping
mechanism of framing goals in &quot;I want to do...&quot; instead of &quot;I want to be...&quot;
seems like it could be effective. I liked the quote &quot;Make better mistakes
tomorrow&quot;.</li>
<li>The second talk about naming things was very good and got me to think about
the structure of doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion metadata (using labels vs taxonomy vs
thesaurus, etc). This will be useful someday I'm sure.</li>
<li>The third talk about [emojii] and the use of emoji was [emojii]. I
never considered using them before, but I will going forward.</li>
<li>The fourth talk mentioned using <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_%28software%29?wprov=sfia1">Selenium</a> to test docs, that just makes
sense. It's so obvious I wish it was easier.</li>
<li>The API Docs talk mentioned that you should give your user the data they will
be working with as a top level priority instead of an after thought. This
will definitely be a priority for me. I already try to give plenty of
examples (since I speak example natively), but I'll be more Conscience of it.</li>
<li>The Design Docs with Disability in Mind was in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing. The big takeaway for
me was keeping the elderly in mind.</li>
<li>The meta talk about crafting a pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion was delivered very well and
mentioned adding contrast slide decks... I should have listened to this
advice...</li>
<li>The second to the last talk of the day covered the plethora of rules we place
on doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion. Having just recently helped es&shy;tab&shy;lished some style guides
for the OSL docs I think we did a good job of giving some leeway to the
writers.  The extreme example of 'Limited rules docs' (e.g., the Python
Doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion) does not really work well for the reader in my experience.</li>
<li>The final talk by some <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> writers equated docs to a garden.  The metaphor
worked sur&shy;pris&shy;ing&shy;ly well.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full list of the talks and their de&shy;scrip&shy;tions, visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/schedule/">event's
schedule</a>.</p>
<p>Day 1 was pretty emojii. We ended the night with emojii at a venue called The
Pub. Many con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tions and laughs were had. I like this crowd.</p>
