&lt;h3&gt;MagicRealismBot Story: August 19, 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl class=&#34;docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Prompt&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;By looking at a fireplace, a medieval sorcerer can turn stone into
moonstones.  &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MagicRealismBot/status/766606956295356420&#34;&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;hr class=&#34;docutils&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellyn scrambled to take notes as fast as she could.  She had finally found a
way to produce &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt; and it would change &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;!  With
&lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt; one could turn sand into gold, the living into the dead, and
countless other &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; properties she had read of.  Now that she was
able to produce that which had alluded sorcerers since the dawn of knowledge
the sky was the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took her quill and parchment and wrote furiously.  She described in great
detail the position of the Sun in the Sky, the time of year, where she stood in
the room and where the room stood on Earth.  She knew every detail wouldn&#39;t be
important but every detail &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be so they all must be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing my robes, staring intently at 12 BoilingRocks in the fireplace,
facing head-first at the display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sun stands high in a Summer&#39;s fore-noon, just glancing through the
window unto the fireplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the duration of approximately three Hail Mary&#39;s the stones turned
white and fragile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rocks no-doubt turned into &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;/strong&gt; as was theorized.  Their
shape and texture proves it so.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MoonStones glow faint white, matte and with hints of spiritual
aura.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;/strong&gt; weigh substantially less than the BoilingRocks did,
perhaps losing mass in the process of transformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she finished writing her findings she grabbed her wax and seal and marked
it to be delivered to her mentor Rowan.  He had spent the better part of his
long life (&lt;em&gt;76 years young!&lt;/em&gt;) attempting to find the secret to producing
&lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt; from earthly materials but had come up empty-handed.  Ellyn felt
proud of her findings and was glad to be able to share it with Rowan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments later Ellyn sent off her findings with a sample of the &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt;
via the local carrier.  She told him to &lt;em&gt;take it with haste to Rowan&lt;/em&gt; and gave
the carrier an extra copper piece in hopes that he would.  The carrier ran off
down the road, the journey was almost a quarter day&#39;s travel so Ellyn returned
to her study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she sat in wait studying the &lt;strong&gt;MoonStones&lt;/strong&gt;, she grew weary of her
findings.  Just a moment ago she was so sure of her discovery, but now that
she had sent off the finding she became... hesitant.  Was this &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt;
or perhaps the similar &lt;em&gt;SilverStone&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;MoonStone&lt;/strong&gt; was only theoretical,
studied in the mind and never before in the hand; it had never been proven to
exist so what made her so sure that &lt;em&gt;this rock&lt;/em&gt; was what they had been
searching for.  She was, after all, just an apprentice sorcerer; what did she
know?  If Rowan determined her findings untrue what would stop him from
revoking his mentor ship?  Her years of study would be for naut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellyn had always been prone to worry. She took a deep breath and with nothing
else to do, she sat in wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Git Does a Lot of Things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should make a tool that extends &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;git&lt;/tt&gt; to delete all of the files matched
by the &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;.gitginore&lt;/tt&gt;.  I spend way too much time crafting &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;find &lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; |
xargs rm&lt;/tt&gt; commands.  I know, I&#39;ll call it &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;git clean&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... before I get too far I&#39;ll just make sure it doesn&#39;t already exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;prompt&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Prompt&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A ghoul and an archbishop are fighting over custody of their children.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MagicRealismBot/status/749301833881915392&#34;&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like every Friday night, Debra picked up her two daughters from her
ex-wife&#39;s house in Evanston and drove them downtown for the weekend.  As she
drove away in her red 2008 Corolla with them she got a text message from her
ex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From: Gwendolyn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debra,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please bring Lilyan and Odell back by 9pm on Sunday.  They have school
Monday morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra became immediately filled with rage.  &lt;em&gt;&#39;Of course they both have school
Monday morning!  I&#39;m not stupid!  I&#39;ve been doing this for four and a half
years goddammit.  How stupid does she think I am?  Christ she can be such a
--&#39;&lt;/em&gt; and before she went down that rabbit hole she remembered what her
therapist said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just breath.  Everything is going to be okay.  This is just temporary.  Her
bitchy behavior only affects you if you let it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra drove a few more miles, her daughters in the back staying cautiously
silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually Lilyan spoke up. &amp;quot;Debora, why does mommy so mean to you?&amp;quot;
deliberately calling Debra (or &lt;strong&gt;Debora&lt;/strong&gt; in Lilyan&#39;s case) by her name and
Gwen by &lt;em&gt;&#39;mommy&#39;&lt;/em&gt;.  This used to bug Debra but she eventually became apathetic
toward the situation.  Gwendolyn had brainwashed the kids; she was honestly
just glad she was able to fight and keep her daughters on the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; mommy so mean to me. And sweety, I&#39;m a ghoul and that means that
&lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people don&#39;t really like me.&amp;quot; Debra said matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Like racism?&amp;quot; Lilyan asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Exactly like racism Lily.  And your mother is a Christian official called an
&#39;Archbishop&#39;.  For some reason, probably some squabble hundreds of years ago
[or maybe they&#39;ve just always been biggots] none of your mother&#39;s bosses liked
that she was in a relationship me so she had to give it up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a momentary pause as the girls thought this over.  Lilyan was six
and Odell was eight, neither of which were really prepared to fully process
what she was saying, but she wanted them to feel respected and independent so
she participated in their questions.  They were both technically Gwendolyn&#39;s
daughters with a donor, Debra would have had child if she was able to but
ghouls had a notorously difficult time doing anything related to &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt;,
creating life included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But why does she not like you?&amp;quot; Lilyan finally asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra sighed.  &amp;quot;Well, I think she doesn&#39;t like me because she wishes we could
still be together.  We had a very romantic fling in the beginning and we
really thought we could stay together but... well it wasn&#39;t meant to last.
She just thinks that this is the best way to deal with the situation.  Some
people would rather feel angry than sad.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilyan quickly followed up with the obvious &amp;quot;Do you feel sad Debora?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra thought for a moment. Lilyan asked again &amp;quot;Do you feel sad Debora?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sometimes sweetie.  Sometimes I feel very sad and it makes it very hard to do
things like go to work and eat food.  Most of the time that happens I remind
myself how lucky I am to have you two to look forward to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilyan didn&#39;t know what else to ask and so the three sat in silence as they
drove down Lake-Shore Drive.  The lamp posts cast yellow-tinged shadows on
their faces as they each looked out the windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odell finally spoke up, &amp;quot;What are we going to do this weekend?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good question.  What do you guys want to do?  I was thinking we could go
mini-golfing once you get your homework done.  How does that sound?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both groaned. Debra smiled &amp;quot;Well I guess it&#39;s settled. Mini putt-putt
tomorrow afternoon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;dl class=&#34;docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Prompt&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;An emperor owns a steam-powered device which allows him to destroy the
past.  &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MagicRealismBot/status/749120629308203009&#34;&gt;MagicRealismBot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;hr class=&#34;docutils&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor Stan of Stantinople, the most prosperous 1500 square feet in all of
&lt;strong&gt;Oak Burch Sunrise Shire&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Suburban [Gated] Community&lt;/em&gt;, ruled with an &lt;em&gt;iron
fist&lt;/em&gt; and an endless stream of &lt;em&gt;Puns&lt;/em&gt;.  His wife and three daughters obeyed
his every whim, when it fit their schedules... and if they were in a good
mood... and they wanted to.  Stan was content with his life as an emperor and
ruler of his domain, no matter how far and wide that domain spanned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Tuesday afternoon, as he stood at the edge of the sidewalk squinting
toward his back yard and telling himself that &lt;em&gt;&#39;Stantinople stretches as far
as the eye can see&#39;&lt;/em&gt;, his mind drifted to the life he could have had.  He
thought about all of the mistakes he had made like when he tried stand-up and
totally bombed, when he got into massive debt from college and dropped out,
and when he bought a house in the suburbs -- the mistakes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seemingly out of nowhere he was tapped on the nose by a delivery woman.  She
told him to sign her PDA and before he could process what was happening she
dropped a thick wooden, about the size of a bedside table, at his doorstep.
He turned around and the woman sped away in an un-marked FedEx van; it didn&#39;t
say FedEx, because it was unmarked, but the color and shape was right so Stan
figured it probably was FedEx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lugged the box into the house and down to the finished basement he (and a
poster in the stairwell leading down to the basement) called the
&lt;strong&gt;&#39;Stantinople Man Cave&#39;&lt;/strong&gt;, despite it not having many &lt;em&gt;Man Cave&lt;/em&gt; amenities
nor being an actual cave for which one might find men.  The entirety of the
basement consisted of three dark brown leather couches lined up in an &#39;L&#39;
formation in the corner and a small, almost child-sized foosball table on the
opposite end of the room.  He didn&#39;t even invest in a wide-screen TV and a few
Lay-Z boy chairs with built-in mini-fridges!  Stan really had no concept of
what a &lt;em&gt;Man Cave&lt;/em&gt; ought to have but nobody really called him on it since he
was obviously trying his sad 43 year-old best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fumbled the box with a &lt;em&gt;WHOOMP&lt;/em&gt; onto the carpet and painlessly opened it
with its &lt;em&gt;No Hassle™ packaging&lt;/em&gt;, an innovation he did not realized had made
its way to wooden packaging.  Removing the item Stan thought this new device
was a sewing machine and he got excited, but upon closer inspection he
realised it was not a sewing machine.  The device was a rectangular cube with
rounded edges and was hollow in the middle except for what looked like some
pistons; the device was matt black and had four rubber feet on the bottom and
was branded &lt;em&gt;&#39;Past Scrubber&#39;&lt;/em&gt;.  He lifted the device out of the box and
flipped &#39;on&#39; the devices only switch; it began to &lt;em&gt;whurrrrrr&lt;/em&gt; like a small
engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stan rummaged through the box and found a piece of paper which read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
May this device only be used by the mightiest and wisest emperors.  With
its mechanical power it may erase both mistakes and triumphs of the past.
It does not discriminate, this is the job of its master.  You are its
master.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sweet! This thing looks cool.&amp;quot; Stan said oblivious to the ominous tone of
this note. &amp;quot;Let&#39;s see... it can change the past.  I wonder what I should
change...&amp;quot; he said foolishly not taking this very serious device seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well first I&#39;d wish I&#39;d never moved out to the suburbs.  That was a huge
mistake.&amp;quot; The machine&#39;s &lt;em&gt;whurrr&lt;/em&gt;&#39;ing intensified and an instant later he found
himself living in a nice apartment near down-town.  Since time had been
altered, and in this universe you don&#39;t remember old timeliness if you change
the past (deal with it), Stan had no idea that anything had changed and had
yet to make his first decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well first I&#39;d wish I never went to college, that was a huge waste of time
just to drop out.&amp;quot; and again (for you, not for him) the machine &lt;em&gt;whurrr&lt;/em&gt;&#39;d
louder and an instant later Stan found himself in a much shittier apartment,
further from downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well first I&#39;d wish I went to college, I really could have done something
with my life.&amp;quot; and the machine didn&#39;t respond because, despite it&#39;s visual
similarities to a sewing machine, the device only knew how to destroy time and
not how to create it.  He would have known this if he read the freaking manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stan quickly grew bored with the device after naming off a few things he
&lt;em&gt;wished&lt;/em&gt; he had done and it just &lt;em&gt;whurr&lt;/em&gt;&#39;ing on.  He switched the machine
&lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; and put it in the corner and muttered to himself &amp;quot;Maybe I can get
something for it on ebay.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&#34;docutils&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a furious bidding war between two hobbyist mechanics Stan got $153 for
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not bad.&amp;quot; He said when the bidding ended. &amp;quot;Not bad indeed.&amp;quot; and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Character Study: The &#39;Try New Things&#39; Couple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwendolyn and Stefan love to try new things.  Not like... &lt;em&gt;sex things&lt;/em&gt;, but
like &lt;em&gt;lifestyle things&lt;/em&gt;.  Take, for example, Gwendolyn decided last week that
she would love to see what life was like if she and Stefan only shared &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt;
bowl, plate, cup, fork, knife, spoon, and pan for a month. She didn&#39;t really
have a good reason for &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; at the time, it&#39;s not like she read it in a
magazine or anything, but they&#39;re young and into wacky stuff like that.  Stefan
always participates in these and likes talking about their &lt;em&gt;adventures&lt;/em&gt; as
they&#39;re happening, but never proposes ideas of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwendolyn requires that people use the full &lt;em&gt;Gwendolyn&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;Gwen&lt;/em&gt; and has
been known to &lt;strong&gt;halt&lt;/strong&gt; conversations if people don&#39;t. She feels was confident
that she loves Stefan three times more than he loves her.  She wasn&#39;t sure why
she felt that way, or where three times came from, but it had always been her
hunch.  Since she&#39;s never been able to confirm or deny it, she has kept on
believing it; this puts her in an artificially smug mood whenever she
sacrifices something for Stefan, like the 5% markup on the organic foods
because he prefers them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan previously refereed to her as &lt;em&gt;Gwen&lt;/em&gt; internally but forced himself to
adapt after a few preventable meltdowns.  He hasn&#39;t ever really considered how
much he loves Gwendolyn, but he regularly thinks about the house they&#39;ll buy
together in a few years.  There isn&#39;t actually a specific house they&#39;re
thinking about, but he still enjoys the fantasy; some women dream of their
wedding day and Stefan dreams of his move-in day.  Year after year they&#39;ve
stayed in the same mid-town loft and will never did move into that house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both definitely &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; each other to the extent that any
twenty-somethings can love one another while still collectively managing to
avoid the question of marriage.  They will eventually break-up, not because of
any one event or central cause, but because people grow up and grow apart.
It&#39;s never anybody&#39;s fault, it&#39;s just how the wind blows.  Some people&#39;s
connections are able to persevere that inevitable break, but this connection
will not.  Gwendolyn knows this and in the back of her head is already thinking
about why a breakup would be best for them.  Stefan has thought about it once
or twice but doesn&#39;t really want things to change.  He likes spending his life
with Gwendolyn and feels like they do share a really close bond, even if that
bond is largely based on things like sharing one bowl, plate, cup, fork, knife,
spoon, and pan for a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the &lt;em&gt;sharing-one-of-everything&lt;/em&gt; thing is working out pretty well.
Gwendolyn hasn&#39;t gotten any of their friends to try it but she really feels
like she&#39;s looking at food and meals in a whole new light.  Stefan thinks it&#39;s
a neat idea, but is looking forward to the end of this month.  He would
never tell her that though.  He loves her too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atmosphere:&lt;/strong&gt; Up-beat. Focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wifi:&lt;/strong&gt; Not an issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seating:&lt;/strong&gt; Available but not plentiful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-frame:&lt;/strong&gt; Thursday Afternoon.  ~2 hrs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service:&lt;/strong&gt; Good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distractions:&lt;/strong&gt; Low volume music.  Minor chitchat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing:&lt;/strong&gt; Medium black coffee (one full mug) was $2 and included a free refill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;experience&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Experience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a place made for people like me.  Six of the nine occupied
tables were were held by somebody working silently on a laptop.  The music was
loud enough to hear but not abrasive; I could easy tune out what was playing
with my headphones at a reasonable volume, but I actually liked their selection
of hip-hop so I opted to soak in the atmosphere rather than isolating myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seating mostly consisted of one long wooden wall-bench servicing six small
tables, each paired with one chair.  The wooden seating didn&#39;t feel
uncomfortable but I wouldn&#39;t say I could sit there for a full work day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time was cut short by the IRS shaking me down over the phone. Oh wait, did I
say the IRS? I meant some asshole scammers.  Here&#39;s that story, because why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;the-irs-scam-story&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The IRS Scam Story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scene:&lt;/strong&gt; The Fresh Pot Cafe, Thursday afternoon.  Not loud but not quiet
either.  I get a call from &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;(360) &lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;208-0783&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; with a robotic voice claiming
something along the lines of &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You are being super-audited. The IRS is going to
rip you a financial new one unless you call back asap&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.  I am not jaded &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;
so I call back right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end up reaching a man with an Indian accent claiming to be...  let me check
my notes... &amp;quot;Officer Victor Brown&amp;quot; of the IRS with the badge ID &amp;quot;VK2019&amp;quot;.  I
didn&#39;t transcribe his entire script, but he basically said that because of some tax
fraud I had committed the IRS was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;arabic simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suing me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sending people to arrest me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going to freeze my bank accounts soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All for offenses between &amp;quot;the years of 2010 and 2015&amp;quot; adding up to the hefty sum
of $1857, and of course I couldn&#39;t resolve this issue unless I talked
directly with his manager.  If I chose not to talk to his manager, I wouldn&#39;t be
able to do anything and I would definitely still get super-audited. He made
this whole manager thing &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point there were a few red flags going off in my head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why didn&#39;t I hear about this earlier?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did it sound like he was in a call center?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait, what? I didn&#39;t even pay taxes in 2010, 2011, &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; 2012?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all seemed like a pretty big hullabaloo for two grand, but I naively agreed
to talk with &amp;quot;Victor&#39;s&amp;quot; manager. Also with an &lt;em&gt;heavy&lt;/em&gt; Indian accent, &amp;quot;Kevin
Butler&amp;quot; did not provide a badge ID. My assumption, of course, being that this was
&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Kevin Butler, the man who needed no introduction nor badge.  You know...
&lt;em&gt;Kevin &amp;quot;The Audit Master of the North&amp;quot; Butler&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This man then went on to give approximately the same spiel citing IRS Tax Code
violations like &amp;quot;13&amp;quot; and other intimidating numbers. At this point I was
walking out the door to some place quieter. I was at about 65% confidence that
this was a scam but needed to concentrate on the conversation to get to 100%.
After his scare-tactics I politely asked if I could ask a question and he said
yes. Here&#39;s more or less how the conversation went from there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&#34;docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;me:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;So... what do you know about me?  Do you know anything about me like...
where I live?  [This seemed like a pretty straight forward question for
literally any government employee looking at a report about you]&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;KB: [angry]&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Is there somebody there with you?  Who is there with you?  Who
is listening to this conversation with you?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;me: [Oh shit.  He caught me.  Oh wait, there was nothing to catch]&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I assure you, there is nobody around.  I&#39;m walking down the street and
literally can&#39;t see anybody.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;KB:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I heard whispers.  Who was that whispering?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;me:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I don&#39;t know what to tell you Kevin.  There really isn&#39;t anybody here with
me.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;KB:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I would really like to move forward.  I do not need to provide these
details to you at this time.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;me: [cutting the foreplay]&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;How do I know this isn&#39;t a scam?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;KB:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Can you provide your debit card information?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;me:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;HELL NO you cannot have my bank account information!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;KB:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Calm down!  That is not what I asked!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;me:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Yes it is!  That is exactly what you asked for!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;KB: [Sounding genuinely annoyed]&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I did not ask for that.  I did not ask for any of your information banking
information.  Did I just ask for you debit, credit, or bank account
information?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;me:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;YES!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*click*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, Kevin hung up on me. I was a changed man in that moment. I was
on the lamb, running from the most menacing branch of the United States
Government: &lt;em&gt;The IRS&lt;/em&gt;. I think I&#39;m going to change my last name to Bourne
tomorrow, it only seems fitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&#34;docutils&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulating people into giving you their money is a deplorable crime against
humanity.  Scams are terrible and feed off of those who already have it tough
enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;align-center&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fuck scammers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the IRS is auditing you they will just send you mail for &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; and will
never call you.  Despite how it may feel sometimes, they are actually in the
business of &lt;strong&gt;making&lt;/strong&gt; money and not in the business of tricking you or making
your life a living hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get any threating calls from any agency of authority ask some &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt;
questions like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say my [&lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt;] name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me my address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What and when exactly did this problem come up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;align-center&#34;&gt;Stay vigilant and don&#39;t fall for stuff like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atmosphere:&lt;/strong&gt; Working / meeting-place for most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wifi:&lt;/strong&gt; A bit on the slow side. My SSH connection had notable lag, browser
tasks weren&#39;t a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seating:&lt;/strong&gt; Plentiful.  Outlets were easy to find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-frame:&lt;/strong&gt; Friday.  11am to 3:00pm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service:&lt;/strong&gt; Fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distractions:&lt;/strong&gt; Low volume music.  Barista chitchat, but nothing overly distracting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing:&lt;/strong&gt; Medium black coffee (one full mug) was $2. Refills $1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;experience&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Experience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Points&lt;/em&gt; was an enjoyable place to work. I&#39;d guess the patron demographics
were spilt evenly between working on laptops, having a meeting, and just
getting a cup of coffee to go. The music was a point of pride for the staff as
it was a way to show off their authentic vinyl collection; while the music
sounded fine I opted to listen to my own music since their selection wasn&#39;t my
taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location was split into two rooms, both with ample seating and one with the
baristas. I spent the first half my day at the front, window-facing, bar and
the second half at a table-for-two near an outlet because laptops need
power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m new to this so I&#39;m not comfortable difinitively saying that this is a good
or bad place to work at. I was able to get things done for four hours and only
left because I was hungry and cheap. I wasn&#39;t pestered to leave at any point
and they passed my &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Adequate Cup of Black Coffee&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; test. The neighborhood is
busy but quiet, and there&#39;s some good people-watching subjects if you&#39;re
interested in that sort of thing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... for instance a guy walked in wearing some sick Geordi La Forge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Geordi La Forge in his sick shades.&#34; src=&#34;http://www.netambulo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/star-trek-glasses.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to Get the Most out of Your Python Exceptions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code python literal-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;Please enter a number not equal to 0: &#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ne&#34;&gt;ZeroDivisionError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;Error: &#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;You had one job!&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first admonition-title&#34;&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;last&#34;&gt;This post does not cover &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; python exceptions are. If the above
code doesn&#39;t make sense you should check out this &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://wiki.python.org/moin/HandlingExceptions&#34;&gt;Introduction to Python
Exceptions&lt;/a&gt; from wiki.python.org before reading this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve fallen in love with Python you&#39;ve no doubt discovered exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code python literal-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# do a thing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# thing did not work,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# do something else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are endlessly useful and help one to avoid writing checks upon checks upon
checks before getting to the meat of your project. Just try a thing, catch the
error, keep on rolling (or fail gracefully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As powerful as they can be, I have found a lot of folks (past me included) who
don&#39;t know how to find python exceptions and don&#39;t know how to write their own
exceptions! So let&#39;s do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;finding-exceptions&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Finding Exceptions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing exception handling code it&#39;s kosher to explicitly state &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt;
error you expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code python literal-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Bad:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# A thing that might not work&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Something else&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Good:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# A thing that might not work&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;SpecificError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Maybe print(err)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Something else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first found this out I thought &lt;em&gt;Golly that does sound useful; I always
try to be explicit in my error handling -- but how??&lt;/em&gt; Thankfully future me is
here to answer questions like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exception you are looking for (for instance, &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;SpecificError&lt;/tt&gt; in the above
pseudo-code) can be found in the python traceback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code text literal-block&#34;&gt;
$ echo &amp;quot;open(&#39;myfakefile.txt&#39;, &#39;r&#39;).close()&amp;quot; &amp;gt; my-unhandled-script.py
$ python my-unhandled-script.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &amp;quot;/tmp/test.py&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;
    open(&#39;myfakefile.txt&#39;, &#39;r&#39;).close()
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: &#39;myfakefile.txt&#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That bit on the last line &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;IOError&lt;/tt&gt; is the exception you&#39;re looking for. So
when you write your code you&#39;ll say something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code python literal-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;myfakefile.txt&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;r&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ne&#34;&gt;IOError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;File `myfakefile.txt` does not exist&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap, here is one way (and my preferred method for) &#39;doing&#39; python
exception handling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;arabic simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write breakable code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run breakable code, see what exceptions python spits out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrap breakable code in explicit &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;try/except&lt;/tt&gt; blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;writing-your-own-exceptions&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Writing Your Own Exceptions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You (who me?), yes &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can write custom python exceptions. It&#39;s dead easy
too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long and short of it is you define an exception class which either inherits
from the &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;Exception&lt;/tt&gt; class or another pre-existing exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code python literal-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;CusssstomError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ne&#34;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;sd&#34;&gt;&#39;&#39;&#39;Raise when snakes&#39;&#39;&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;bp&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;check_for_snakes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;snake&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;CusssstomError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;Snakes! I hate snakes!&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Just don&#39;t mention snakes: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;check_for_snakes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;CusssstomError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks. I appreciate it.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above code defines the &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;CusssstomError&lt;/tt&gt; exception class which you can
&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;raise&lt;/tt&gt;. Very neat and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-pythonic&#34;&gt;pythonic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;further-reading&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few references I suggest you check out to get an even better grasp
on exception handling and custom exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Stack Overflow post: &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1319615/proper-way-to-declare-custom-exceptions-in-modern-python&#34;&gt;Proper way to declare custom exceptions in modern

&lt;h3&gt;How to Develop a Site for the Web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first admonition-title&#34;&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post does not deal with the basics of HTML, CSS, or Javascript, but
rather a simple and often overlooked part of the web-dev toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;last&#34;&gt;If you would like help with the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript I suggest
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website&#34;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Development, especially the front-endy stuff, is a great way to understand
how computers &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; and can be a wonderful foray into computer programming.
Anybody that&#39;s made a website probably remembers their first time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;arabic simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up a text editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type something like the following in:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code html literal-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world!&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is so cool!&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;arabic simple&#34; start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;Save As index.html&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click and open the file in your browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marvel at what you&#39;ve created and hack away at it all night long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you go! You&#39;ve got a website made and ready to roll. It&#39;s not on a
server, and you can&#39;t tell your friends to go to it from &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; computer --
but those are just technicalities. You can still celebrate doing a thing &lt;em&gt;like a
boss&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when you test your website by viewing local files you&#39;re missing
out on a lot of advantages and quirks that you get when you host a website on a
&lt;em&gt;real server&lt;/em&gt; using something like &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server&#34;&gt;Apache or Nginx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when you run check your website by clicking through
&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;file///home/username/project/files.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; all of your hyperlinks that should
point to &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;http://mywebsite.ext/somepage/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will take you to &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;file:////somepage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
when they should take you to
&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;file:///home/username/projects/myawesomesite/somepage/index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;run-a-development-server-it-s-easy&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Run A Development Server (it&#39;s easy!)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;the-short-answer&#34;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Short Answer&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Python!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code text literal-block&#34;&gt;
$ python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;the-longer-answer&#34;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Longer Answer&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run your own local webserver to serve files &lt;em&gt;locally&lt;/em&gt;. This gets you
all of the developmental advantages of running a webserver without having to
rent or run a server in the cloud. The best part is that it&#39;s very easy to run
a development web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;arabic simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://python.org/downloads/&#34;&gt;Install Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;your-awesome-website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; directory/folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;python &lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; SimpleHTTPServer&lt;/tt&gt; if you installed &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;python2&lt;/tt&gt; or run
&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;python &lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; http.server&lt;/tt&gt; if you installed &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;python3&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;first admonition-title&#34;&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;last&#34;&gt;These instructions assume you are doing things in a Unix environment (OSX
or Linux) thought the commandline. If you are using Windows you should
check out this &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17351016/set-up-python-simplehttpserver-on-windows&#34;&gt;stack overflow post&lt;/a&gt; for Windows-specific help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in your web browser go to the address &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;http://localhost:8000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and bam!
&lt;strong&gt;Your&lt;/strong&gt; Website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;&#39;High Five&#39; gif&#34; src=&#34;http://media.riffsy.com/images/ba88f72dbccae632dcfd4c80a732f9b9/raw&#34;/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Running Firefox in Docker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out you can run Firefox in Docker. It&#39;s actually pretty easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;code&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Code&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/29e7e829341d58abe370&#34;&gt;my github gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/29e7e829341d58abe370.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installation instructions (on Linux):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code text literal-block&#34;&gt;
# install docker and start the docker daemon
$ git clone https://gist.github.com/29e7e829341d58abe370.git docker-firefox
$ ln docker-firefox/ff-docker /some/path/for/binaries
$ ff-docker -b  # -b pulls &amp;amp; builds container, etc used for first time startup.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted to use &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://alpinelinux.org/&#34;&gt;Alpine Linux&lt;/a&gt; as a proof-of-usability, since it&#39;s the hip
new kid on the containerization block &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://elijahcaine.me/blog/running-firefox-in-docker/index.html/#id3&#34; id=&#34;id1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, but as it turns out Alpine&#39;s
Firefox package is pretty fucked &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://elijahcaine.me/blog/running-firefox-in-docker/index.html/#id4&#34; id=&#34;id2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dmenu&#34;&gt;dmenu&lt;/a&gt;, this means I can run &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;ff-docker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; from my desktop without
opening a terminal, effectively making it a super-private-yet-convenient
drop-in for Firefox.  Pretty neat right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was pretty simple but effective in terms of giving me the option to have
more privacy. I can see it being extended to add even more security; e.g.,
routing all of the traffic in the container through a VPN would be easy enough.
Food for thought [citation needed].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;docutils footnote&#34; frame=&#34;void&#34; id=&#34;id3&#34; rules=&#34;none&#34;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class=&#34;label&#34;/&gt;&lt;col /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign=&#34;top&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;label&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;fn-backref&#34; href=&#34;http://elijahcaine.me/blog/running-firefox-in-docker/index.html/#id1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5mb containers sounds pretty nice to me.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://gliderlabs.viewdocs.io/docker-alpine/&#34;&gt;http://gliderlabs.viewdocs.io/docker-alpine/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;docutils footnote&#34; frame=&#34;void&#34; id=&#34;id4&#34; rules=&#34;none&#34;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class=&#34;label&#34;/&gt;&lt;col /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign=&#34;top&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;label&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;fn-backref&#34; href=&#34;http://elijahcaine.me/blog/running-firefox-in-docker/index.html/#id2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I get a segfault every time I try to start Firefox. More info here:

&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CatBarcamp 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend I went to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://catbarcamp.org/&#34;&gt;Cat Barcamp 2015&lt;/a&gt;, an unconference run by the PSU
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://cat.pdx.edu/&#34;&gt;Computer Action Team&lt;/a&gt;. I went to some awesome talks (and gave one myself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed every talk I went to. Here they are in order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;arabic&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class=&#34;first docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History of Cryptography.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first last&#34;&gt;This was given by one of my OSL co-workers. It didn&#39;t contain a ton of new
information for me, but was delivered very well and focused on different
types of cryptography and the context in which each one was developed. I
enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class=&#34;first docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haskell on Steroids.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first last&#34;&gt;I kinda checked out during this talk because I wanted to write my slides...
Wooops. It looked very interesting and mathey though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class=&#34;first docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Test Driven Development in Power Shell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first last&#34;&gt;Whoa Windows! (actually though, I learned more about Power Shell than I
ever expected to know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class=&#34;first docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MY TALK.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first last&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://elijahcaine.me/blog/cat-barcamp-2015/index.html/#my-talk&#34;&gt;(see below)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class=&#34;first docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Whirlwind Tour of Lojban.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first last&#34;&gt;Lojban seems like a cool language. Corbin (previous LUG president) gave
this talk, he&#39;s a cool guy... you might even say he&#39;s TheMostAwesomeDude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class=&#34;first docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adventures in IT Security: Then and now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first last&#34;&gt;I like history. I also like computers. This was a good talk. I am biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class=&#34;first docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking to people! (or, How I learned to stop worrying and love the user.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first last&#34;&gt;Spoiler: The secret is understanding social cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;my-talk&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My Talk&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided on the spur of the moment to give a talk &#39;How to Write a (very
mediocre) Static Site Generator&#39; and with only 40 minutes of prep work I was
able to fill an hour pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some links from that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/0ee1ef21692f3cbb6934&#34;&gt;demo code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://elijahcaine.me/catbarcamp2015-demo/&#34;&gt;abomination of a website&lt;/a&gt; we built between the demo and the end of the
session (epilepsy warning... no seriously).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://slides.elijahcaine.me/cat-barcamp-2015_how-to-an-ssg/&#34;&gt;very sparse slides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;TLDR&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAT is an awesome group of people. I&#39;m glad I was able to get a few LUG
members to come to the event. If I went to PSU I would be honored to work with
the CAT. They throw a hellofan event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Covertly Installing Packages with Docker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://elijahcaine.me/blog/covertly-installing-packages-with-docker/index.html/#the-deets-dockerfile-and-commands&#34;&gt;Jump to the codey bits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;the-problem-workstations&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Problem: Workstations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the OSL I use workstations which are provisioned by &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_%28software%29&#34;&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt; to look more or
less identical (packages are the same and global config files are consistent
from machine to machine). This is nice because it allows everybody at the lab
to jump from workstation to workstation without dreading the inevitable setup
that usually comes with going to a new computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside here is that to install a package you have to make a pull
request to a GitHub Repository in which you modify a JSON file. This is almost
always for my own good, but as a dev I am prone to avoiding things that the
admins say are good for me (like broccoli, milk, and consistent workstation
environments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, yesterday I wanted to use &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/&#34;&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/a&gt; to grab a video I was
watching on repeat*. I could have made a pull request to add the package,
waited until 30 after for the workstations to refresh, used the package, and
went about my day. This would have been the correct and bureaucratic way to do
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have, and probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have, done that... but I didn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* firefox kept crashing, I wasn&#39;t just stealing music for the sake of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;enter-docker&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Enter: Docker&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the solution to the &#39;problem&#39; was &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote a Dockerfile
which provisioned a container to have &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; installed, spun up the
container with a shared directory (&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;$PWD:/home/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;), and executed the
youtube-dl command. The .mp4 video was downloaded to my current working
directory and I was able to play it with my media player of choice, all without
installing &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;the-deets-dockerfile-and-commands&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Deets: Dockerfile and Commands&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code text literal-block&#34;&gt;
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get -y update
RUN apt-get -y upgrade
RUN apt-get -y install python-pip
RUN pip install youtube-dl

WORKDIR /home
RUN alias youtube-dl=&#39;/usr/local/bin/youtube-dl&#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the directory containing the above Dockerfile, build the
container with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code text literal-block&#34;&gt;
$ docker build -t yt-dl .
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and run it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code text literal-block&#34;&gt;
$ docker run -v $PWD:/home/ yt-dl youtube-dl &amp;lt;YOUTUBE-VID-URL&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will download any url&#39;s video into the current working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;pro-tip-add-an-alias&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pro-Tip: Add an &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;Alias&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following content to your &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; file and then run &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;source
&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to get rid the of long Docker bits of the above command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;code bash literal-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$VID_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/path/to/downloaded/videos/
&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; yt-dl&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;docker run -v $VID_DIR:/home/ yt-dl youtube-dl&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;wait-this-is-overly-complicated&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wait This is Overly Complicated&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re probably thinking: &amp;quot;Hey, couldn&#39;t you have just run &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;pip install &lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;--user&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. I could have. But that wouldn&#39;t be fun and wouldn&#39;t have given me an
excuse to write a blog, post now would it Ms. Smarty Pantz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&#34;docutils&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;drink the coolaid. come to the docker side.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How To Possibly Kinda Sorta Write a Travelblog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First thing&#39;s First: I went on a trip and wrote a travelblog.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a link to that travelblog itself check out&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://elijahcaine.me/eurotrip-2015&#34;&gt;elijahcaine.me/eurotrip-2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This post is _about_ that travelblog.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on a whirlwind two week trip to Europe; first to Amsterdam (&#39;because
Amsterdam&#39; seems like a reasonable justification for doing this according to
most people) and second to Prague to speak at the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/schedule/&#34;&gt;European Write the Docs
conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve traveled before and I wanted to avoid the inevitable that tends to happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;arabic simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I go on a trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a wonderful time and make lots of memories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get back from trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get asked &amp;quot;Tell me about your trip!&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forget everything that happened on the trip and sum it up with &#39;It was
great.&#39;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat this seemingly inevitable outcome I decided to write a blog about
&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; trip as the trip was happening. Similar to how some might make daily
Facebook posts or Tweets, I could use this as a way to not only spend time each
day processing what happened but I could also refer friends and family to the
blog&#39;s url so they could follow along vicariously if they chose. I wanted to
make a website where I updated the world on my whereabouts and shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;the-technical-parts&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Technical Parts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m an engineer. Like many engineers I like to tinker and build things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago I built a tool called &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/elijahcaine/pageup#pageup-init-pageup-build&#34;&gt;PageUp&lt;/a&gt;; it takes a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText&#34;&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;
formatted &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language&#34;&gt;markup file&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system&#34;&gt;html template&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some other files that
make the web go &#39;round and look half-way decent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using that tool (PageUp) I created a blog that I could update from my phone
using &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/352cb120743af2dde7c8&#34;&gt;a Github Gist&lt;/a&gt; and a slick &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.git-scm.com/&#34;&gt;Git Source Control&lt;/a&gt; program for my phone.
I could write a reStructuredText formatted blog post, sync it to the web, have
my personal server pull the updated version of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/352cb120743af2dde7c8&#34;&gt;git repository&lt;/a&gt;, and
automatically rebuild the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;the-writing-parts&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Writing Parts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updates were surprisingly painless-- and I&#39;m not just saying that to sell
PageUp, I&#39;m honestly just impressed that I made something which actually made
my life easier. Feels good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t as consistent with writing posts as I had envisioned. I wrote posts
the day after the events occurred, which wasn&#39;t too bad, until I went to Write
the Docs got completely torn away from my rigorous &#39;Drink Coffee, Write
Blogpost, Adventure&#39; regimen; I kept getting distracted by meeting new people
and socializing. Ugh, the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;thoughts-and-conclusions&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Thoughts and Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I suspect I&#39;ll continue doing liveblogs when I go to events, it&#39;s a
great way to share the experience with others and augment one&#39;s memory with a
written record of the time you spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus it&#39;s just fun an nerdy to write scripts and programs to make this whole
experience as user friendly as possible. If I poured even more time into this
it could even be a startup...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;write-the-docs-day-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Write the Docs: Day 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like yesterday, I spent most of today enjoying some wonderful talks as
well as stressing out -- I mean totally not stressing out -- about my own talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;Write the Docs Staff Picture&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/CeB82W5.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Write the Docs Staff saying thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first talk of the day was titled &amp;quot;Judas Priest Ate My Scrum Master&amp;quot;,
which has almost nothing to do with Judas Priest or eating or scrum masters;
instead it talked about things that are well known issues and a lot of laws
(&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%E2%80%99_law&#34;&gt;Brooks&#39; Law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman&#39;s_laws_of_software_evolution&#34;&gt;Lehmann&#39;s Laws&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle&#34;&gt;Pareto Principle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_law&#34;&gt;Conway&#39;s Law&lt;/a&gt;,
etc) that nobody talks about that much but can be super helpful to consider
when working in an industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second talk covered different types of user interfaces and what to
consider when writing error messages, troubleshooting pages, product tours.
It was something I hadn&#39;t considered having primarily written command line
tools with pretty limited and well established interface guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I gave a talk. It was a talk. I&#39;ll post a video of it once those
get put up online and you can decide if it was good or bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The talk after mine was a nice history lesson and wanted the audience to
reflect on what documentations can learn from documentation practices of the
past. The TLDR on that one is that it used to suck to write technical docs
even more than it sucks now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then there were a bunch of lightning talks. One talk from a twitter employee
(there&#39;s a fun name for them I&#39;m sure) mentioned that gathering metrics are
is important because without metrics everything you do is just guess and
check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next talk &amp;quot;MacGyvering your docs&amp;quot; brought up the fact that the best
documentation toolchain will (should?) only help existing developers. A
better toolchain won&#39;t attract new devs. That was something I think a lot of
projects can lose sight of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The talk after that covered a team of scientists studying clouds (water
clouds not internet clouds) using computer simulations. They wrote and
documented a piece of software and they ended up publishing their program&#39;s
documentation in a scientific journal. It&#39;s already been sited and
everything. I hadn&#39;t even considered that as a possibility (publishing docs
as a scientific paper).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next two talks were pretty short (15 minute) talks about putting the data
where the users need it and an introduction to screen-casting. The first was
good for documenting things like an API and the second was good if I ever
need to make a screen-cast. I doubt that will happen, but you never know!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last talk &amp;quot;All roads might not lead to docs&amp;quot; held too main takeaways for
me: The quote &lt;em&gt;The Purpose of this document is ________&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://voiceandtone.com/&#34;&gt;mailchimp
voice &amp;amp; tone guide&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very good document I suggest you read it
(the title is pretty self explanatory I think).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a full list of talks given at the conference, check out the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/schedule/&#34;&gt;event&#39;s
schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The after party ended up happening at two venues since we got pre-maturely
kicked out of the first one; we made the best of it and I got to talk to Anna
Jaruga (the cloud research scientist) as well as a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&#34;&gt;Mozilla Development
Network&lt;/a&gt; writer, both very interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of today enjoying the Write the Docs talks and (air
conditioned) venue. I took some notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The keynote about the imposter syndrome was very relatable. The coping
mechanism of framing goals in &amp;quot;I want to do...&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;I want to be...&amp;quot;
seems like it could be effective. I liked the quote &amp;quot;Make better mistakes
tomorrow&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second talk about naming things was very good and got me to think about
the structure of documentation metadata (using labels vs taxonomy vs
thesaurus, etc). This will be useful someday I&#39;m sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third talk about [emojii] and the use of emoji was [emojii]. I
never considered using them before, but I will going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fourth talk mentioned using &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_%28software%29?wprov=sfia1&#34;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; to test docs, that just makes
sense. It&#39;s so obvious I wish it was easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The API Docs talk mentioned that you should give your user the data they will
be working with as a top level priority instead of an after thought. This
will definitely be a priority for me. I already try to give plenty of
examples (since I speak example natively), but I&#39;ll be more Conscience of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Design Docs with Disability in Mind was interesting. The big takeaway for
me was keeping the elderly in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The meta talk about crafting a presentation was delivered very well and
mentioned adding contrast slide decks... I should have listened to this
advice...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second to the last talk of the day covered the plethora of rules we place
on documentation. Having just recently helped established some style guides
for the OSL docs I think we did a good job of giving some leeway to the
writers.  The extreme example of &#39;Limited rules docs&#39; (e.g., the Python
Documentation) does not really work well for the reader in my experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final talk by some &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&#34;&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt; writers equated docs to a garden.  The metaphor
worked surprisingly well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a full list of the talks and their descriptions, visit the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/schedule/&#34;&gt;event&#39;s
schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1 was pretty emojii. We ended the night with emojii at a venue called The
Pub. Many conversations and laughs were had. I like this crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Prague Day 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on a wonderful &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/#events&#34;&gt;city tour&lt;/a&gt; of Prague provided by Write The Docs. We
crossed some bridges, saw some castles, and experienced many wonderful parts of
the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/CkzXuxl.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/CkzXuxl.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&#39;s me in front of a church eating some gelato.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tour I was very hungry and tagged along with some folks from my tour
group on a journey to get food. We went to a restaurant that brought us beer on
a model train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/iJujmTR.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/iJujmTR.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the train that brought us beer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some picture I took of the buildings in the city. I like the
architecture a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/y6Rbrin.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/y6Rbrin.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/WD6k8xa.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/WD6k8xa.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are so cool. I haven&#39;t found the words to describe why, but the asthetics
please me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tour and food there was a &lt;em&gt;Write the Docs Conference Reception&lt;/em&gt; (aka
meet &amp;amp; greet) where I got to hang out with many of the attendees of the
conference. There was food and fabulous people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not have a hard time falling asleep that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;i-strongly-dislike-travel&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I Strongly Dislike Travel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say I hate travel, but that level of hyperbole is literally the worst
thing on the planet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My strong dislike for travel comes mostly from my personal inability to trust
the systems that will get me to where I am going. If I have a flight in one
week and I have to take a bus or train to the airport, I will spend the entire
week running through my head &amp;quot;When is my flight? Umm days, yeesh hours, and ack
minutes. How am I getting there? The oh God bus leaving at some time, somewhere
bound.  Once you get there you will go through security which will take between
5 minutes and 2 hours. Budget your time appropriately.  Any of these systems
can fail and based on experience they have&amp;quot; over and over and over. The stress
is compounded when people don&#39;t always speak your language and you forgot to
eat a proper meal the morning of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is why I am 3 hours early to my flight from Amsterdam to Prague. I
regret nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is going to take me forever to remember &lt;em&gt;25 here monies is about 1 home
monies&lt;/em&gt;. Everything is gonna feel really expensive I bet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;i-made-it-to-prague&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I Made it to Prague&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made it to Prague just fine. They have a cool train system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way cooler than the underground train systems I&#39;m used to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;my-butt-hurts&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My Butt Hurts...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went on an awesome bike ride all the way to Haarlem (15km west of
Amsterdam). I didn&#39;t actually do anything there; I just went, picked up snacks,
and headed back. I&#39;m 99% sure I missed out on an awesome Haarlem exclusive
cultural experience, but if was really more about the journey (I originally set
out to bike to the coast and Haarlem was my compromise to that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/T9jv0xp.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/T9jv0xp.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I found a very neat park near the Western edge of Amsterdam; I ended
up spending an hour or so there having a picnic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/xrVnV3e.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/xrVnV3e.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was a cool abandoned building I found. I like abandoned
buildings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also found this awesome trash can for people riding bikes. It&#39;s
genius.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PONIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bike ride I was very tired. I slept a lot. And yet not enough...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;small-and-large-appreciations&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Small (and Large) Appreciations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of some of the traits of Amsterdam (and what I have experienced
of the Netherlands at large) which I appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have signs that tell you you&#39;re going the wrong direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can bike to another city and be on bike paths the whole time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bikes are easy to use and aren&#39;t shoe-horned in as a second class mode of
transportation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trains are so quiet. Why can&#39;t America have quiet trains?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list will probably grow as I remember things. All in all I like the city
and the country. You should visit if you haven&#39;t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thursday 2015-08-27&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I visited the Van Gough museum. I tried to get in using my mom&#39;s
Amsterdam Museum Pass, but it didn&#39;t fly there like it did at the Rijks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty fun, but the entire experience felt very artificial and plastic.
The paintings were great to see in person, but everything around the pieces
felt a little tacky. My opinion will likely change about it, but I did not
enjoy the Van Gough museum nearly as much as I enjoyed the Rijks Museum,
despite my love for Van Gough and his works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the day walking around and cashed in early. Jetlag + lots
of walking = ready for bed by 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;the-rijks-museum&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Rijks Museum&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&#39;m not sure which street I took this panorama on, but I think it looks
awesome. It captures the Amsterdam canal street pretty well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went to the Rijks Museum and had a bit of a culture overload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/Ic9NAY1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/Ic9NAY1.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody got selfies with Van Gough, so I got a selfie The Milkmaid.  I
realize in retrospect that it doesn&#39;t work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, this is my face when I realized the bathroom stalls go from
floor to ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/EI3v0DS.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/EI3v0DS.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, this photo was taken in the bathroom stall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is a classy restaurant I found with classy lamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They were closed, otherwise I would have gone in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;some-travel-tips&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some Travel Tips&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have not completed my trip, I have some tips to share
with you about travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always bring a &#39;Go Bag&#39; when you go out for the day. Fill it with snacks and
necessities and leave plenty of room for memorabilia you get while out and
about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try something new before defaulting to your comfort zone. This is true for
food as well as experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always being plenty of snacks and water. You will regret it if you don&#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be patient. You invested a lot to get here, make it count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a museum, take a picture of the plackard after taking a picture of the
piece so you don&#39;t forget what it&#39;s called.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t be afraid to sit in a café and just read for a bit. Sometimes that&#39;s as
culturally diversifying as a day in a museum or city tour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flight was uneventful. It was the longest one I&#39;ve ever been on, which is
always a rough milestone to overcome, but actually one of the better flights
I&#39;ve taken. TIL Delta&#39;s service does not suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually sleep the entire way to &amp;lt;insert location here&amp;gt;, but I managed to stay
productive (coding, reading, writing) for the majority of flight. I must say,
it was nice to have my own personal screen to catch up on Last Week Tonight.
I&#39;ve wanted to watch that show for ages...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Lazy bliss not pictured&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;day-0-part-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 0: Part 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wrote down some thoughts about Amsterdam thus far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People keep using fake made up words. What&#39;s up with that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The roads are tiny but people keep driving on them. It looks like chaos but I
haven&#39;t seen an accident yet. I&#39;m kinda impressed. People aren&#39;t even yelling
at each other about almost getting hit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The toilet paper squares are actually rectangles. It might just be the toilet
paper at the place I am staying. Either way, I can&#39;t deal with this aspect
ratio change. I might not be able to poop in Amsterdam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trains are so quiet. I didn&#39;t want to get off...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s some pictures I took:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/gr8VYfD.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/gr8VYfD.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view from the location I am staying at.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/xZ4Kxx5.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/xZ4Kxx5.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A panorama from the park outside of where I am staying.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/7kCRjew.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/7kCRjew.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some goats I found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaaaaaaand naptime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;day-0-part-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 0: Part 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished today by going to the Red Light District. There
were a lot of half naked ladies in windows. They kept winking
at me. I&#39;m pretty sure they liked me; it&#39;s not like they
&lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; have a monetary incentive to get my attention or
anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up finding a bar and enjoying a Belgian White Beer.
It tasted &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/1534/&#34;&gt;surprisingly good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/ab22x3s.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/ab22x3s.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So this is what it feels like to drink in a bar... neat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sunday 2015-08-23&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;section&#34; id=&#34;all-packed&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;All Packed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m all packed up and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure align-center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/gtFk6YA.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/gtFk6YA.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left:&lt;/strong&gt; Chargers, electronics, entertainment, toiletries, water bottle,
wallet, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Center:&lt;/strong&gt; The bag, the &lt;em&gt;Write the Docs&lt;/em&gt; shirt I&#39;ll be wearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right:&lt;/strong&gt; Clothing. Gameboy SP at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; bag of things to bring to Europe, but certainly solid and
most of it practical. I&#39;m packing an extra bag for all of the trinkets I&#39;ll
bring back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you want anything (if you know how to contact me we&#39;re close
enough for you to ask.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
